# Architecture Scoring

Use Attribute-Driven Design (ADD) approach to iterate and build software with ease.

## Project description

### Problem

There are wonderful approaches to designing architecture like ADD.
But there are no tools that help follow the approach.

### Solution

A tool for architecture evaluation. The base for the tool is evolution theory matrix. Rows are
non-functional requirements and columns are components. Component specification should be in
plantUML format. One component of the tool is the ability to show diff between versions in
plantUML.

### Software to deliver

VSCode extension to view UML of software with scoring of architecture to show strong and weak spots.
- Integration with git for version control system and diff view
- Parser for PlantUML and UML viewer
- Integrated ADD system workflow and architecture formula scoring

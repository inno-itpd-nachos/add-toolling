# Strategic Plan
## Project Goals
* Version-based quality tracking with quality correlation capabilities

* Research-grade tool with academic rigor and data analysis

* Community-driven platform with patterns library and marketplace



## Threshold of Success
* Functional requirements: parser accuracy, matrix functionality, data persistence
* Performance requirements: activation speed, parsing speed, UI responsiveness: 
* Quality and reliability: error handling, cross-platform support
* User experience: interface clarity, accessibility
* Measurable documentation standards

## Feature roadmap
* Week 1 [Oct 24 - Oct 31]: Team information, research, and strategic planning

* Week 2 [Oct 31 - Nov 07]: Refine backlog, finalize architecture decisions, stub core services

* Week 3 [Nov 07 - Nov 14]: PlantUML parser and persistence layer with seed data

* Week 4 [Nov 14 - Nov 21]: Matrix UI implementation and file watcher integration

* Week 5 [Nov 21 - Nov 28]: Scoring logic, version storage APIs, happy-path evaluation

* Week 6 [Nov 28 - Dec 05]: Diff visualizations and user feedback collection

* Week 7 [Dec 05 - Dec 12]: Reporting, accessibility, onboarding documentation

* Week 8 [Dec 12 - Dec 19]: Integration testing, CI/CD automation, performance tuning

* Week 9 [Dec 19 - Dec 26]: Security review, deployment guides, course presentation

## Progress monitoring

* Weekly sprint reviews featuring production-ready increments and validation of acceptance checklists
* Performance dashboard (GitHub board, burndown chart) tracking story velocity, unresolved items, and automated test coverage
* Weekly stakeholder meetings with the customer to verify assumptions, align priorities, and gather qualitative insights

## Contingency Plans 

Six identified risks with medium-to-high probability, each including mitigation strategies and concrete contingency actions for: parser complexity, version comparison challenges, large diagram performance, cross-platform issues, team member unavailability, and scope creep.

# Overview

Team meeting to discuss last sprint:
- What was good
    - every team member got assigned for some new type of tasks to do and got just a bit of development in specific areas
- What was bad
    - inconvinient to write reports based on other reports (like C3 based on google docs with no copy in repo)
        - solution: writing assignments in .md or .typst template

No customer overview of the sprint is needed as it feels useless at the current point. Probably we will start review meetings with customer from sprint-3/sprint-4
